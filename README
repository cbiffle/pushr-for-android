PUSHR - FOR ANDROID

Welcome to the Pushr for Android source tree!  To build this code, there are
a few things you'll need:
 1. Java 1.5 or later.
 2. The Android SDK.
 3. Ant (1.6+) or Eclipse (3.3+)
 4. A Flickr API key and shared secret.
 5. For now, a hand-generated Flickr API access token.


SETTING UP THE FLICKR API KEY

The Pushr sources do not include the Pushr API key or shared secret, because
while we're happy to let you build our code, we're less happy to have your
code masquerading as us as far as Flickr is concerned.  The official Pushr
API key is used only for official Pushr builds.

To obtain your own for development, see Flickr's developer site -- it's free.

For the moment, Pushr for Android is unable to do the auth handshake and obtain
an auth token unassisted.  You'll need to do this manually, a process which is
outside the scope of this document.

Once you have all this info, create a file at res/values/secrets.xml using the
following template:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <resources>
    <string name="api_key">YOUR_API_KEY</string>
	 <string name="shared_secret">YOUR_SHARED_SECRET</string>
    <string name="auth_token">YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN</string>
  </resources>


BUILDING WITH ECLIPSE

This assumes Eclipse 3.3 or later, with the Android Developer Tools already
installed.

 1. Open Eclipse.
 2. Import the sources, using File > Import > Existing Projects Into Workspace.
 3. The sources will build automagically.

To run:
 1. Open the Run Configurations dialog (Run > Run Configurations...)
 2. Choose Android from the list on the left.
 3. Click the "New Configuration" button (a little page with a star)
 4. Enter the Pushr project name.
 5. Click Run.
 6. Next time, just choose this configuration (Run > Run History > ...)


BUILDING WITH ANT

 1. Open a terminal.
 2. cd to the source checkout.
 3. cp default.properties build.properties
 4. Edit build.properties to point to the location of your Android SDK.
 3. ant

To install:
 1. ant install

You'll need to run the app by hand, from the Applications launcher.


RUNNING THE TESTS

Currently, the tests must be run from the terminal.

 1. Make sure the Android SDK tools/ directory is in your PATH.
 2. cd to the source checkout.
 3. cd test
 4. ant install
 5. adb -e class <test suite class you wish to run> \
       -w org.mg8.pushr.droid.tests/android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner
